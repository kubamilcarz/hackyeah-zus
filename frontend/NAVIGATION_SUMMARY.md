# Navigation Update Summary

## What was changed

We successfully removed the `FlowNavigation` component and implemented direct navigation handling within each step page. Here's what was updated:

### ✅ Pages Updated

1. **Welcome Page (`/`)** - Already had direct navigation
2. **Signup Page (`/signup`)** - Updated to use state management navigation
3. **First Survey (`/firstSurvey`)** - Updated to use state management navigation  
4. **Missing Data (`/missingData`)** - Updated to use state management navigation
5. **Add Sources (`/addSources`)** - Updated to use state management navigation
6. **Result Page (`/result`)** - Updated to use state management navigation + data integration
7. **Second Survey (`/secondSurvey`)** - Updated to use state management navigation
8. **Dashboard (`/dashboard`)** - Already had proper navigation

### ✅ Navigation Pattern

Each page now follows this pattern:

```tsx
import { useStepProgression } from "@/lib/store";

export default function MyPage() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { completeCurrentStep, nextStep } = useStepProgression();

  const handleNext = () => {
    // Save any page-specific data to state
    completeCurrentStep();  // Mark current step as completed
    nextStep();            // Move to next step
    router.push('/next-page'); // Navigate to next page
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Page content */}
      <button onClick={handleNext}>Continue</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### ✅ Removed Components

- `FlowNavigation` component is no longer used
- Each page handles its own navigation logic
- Step progression is managed through the state management system

### ✅ Benefits

1. **Simpler architecture** - No shared navigation component to maintain
2. **Better control** - Each page can customize its navigation behavior
3. **State integration** - Navigation is tightly coupled with state management
4. **Consistent step tracking** - All navigation goes through the step progression system

### ✅ State Management Integration

- All pages now properly update the step state when navigating
- Data is saved to atoms before navigation
- Step completion is tracked consistently
- Back navigation through the header back button works properly

## Current Flow

1. **Welcome** → saves expected retirement → **Signup**
2. **Signup** → saves demographics → **First Survey**
3. **First Survey** → **Missing Data**
4. **Missing Data** → saves estimated amounts → **Add Sources**
5. **Add Sources** → saves retirement sources → **Result**
6. **Result** → **Second Survey**
7. **Second Survey** → **Dashboard**

Each transition properly:
- Completes the current step
- Advances to the next step  
- Saves relevant data to state
- Navigates to the correct page
